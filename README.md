# k3pro-python
Test code for reading k3 pro thermometer using python.

Code is based from code on comment from this youtube video.

I modified it since 2 temperature shows consecutively and the decimal of the 2nd temp value is not included on python script output. The 2nd temp value is rounded off and is shown on thermometer screen.
